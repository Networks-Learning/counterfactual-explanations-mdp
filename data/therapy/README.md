# Regarding the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy dataset

The patient data used in the experiments were collected during a clinical trial with the patients' written consent and they were shared by the official owners to the authors. Since the authors are not the official owners of the data, currently, the data cannot be made publicly available. A processed version of the dataset may get published in the future.
